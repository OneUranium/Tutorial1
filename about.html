    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <P>Hello my name is One , i'm a passionate cosplayer from Botswana. I've been making my own cosplay costumes for about 5 yeares now bringing many of my favourite characters to life. My journey began after seeing amazing artists cosplay characters from my favourite anime. living in Botswana made it hard for me to have access to these costumes, I started making my own costumes so i could look like my favourite characters. </P>
    <P> Throughout my cosplaying career ive made some wonderful costumes and got to work with many famous cosplayers like Linda Le to bring such high quality costumes to Batswana that want to cosplay. Each costume is made with love combined wih my sewing skill and my passion for dressing up.</P>
    <P> On this website you will get to see a collection of my work this incuding detailedd photos too. I hope my costumes get to inspire you like the characters inspire me </P>
    <p> Feel free to check out my gallery or get in touch with me through the contact page. Thank you for visiting <3 </p>
